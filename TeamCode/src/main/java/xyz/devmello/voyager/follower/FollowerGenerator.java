/**
 * A functional interface used for generating followers. Pathfinder operates
 * based on a couple of core ideas - firstly, trajectories, and secondly,
 * followers. Pathfinder's movement is controlled via an executor manager,
 * which, in turn, controls several follower executors. Each of these follower
 * executors (you guessed it) executes a set of followers. Each of these
 * followers instructs the robot on how to follow a certain trajectory.
 *
 * <p>
 * Pathfinder can be commanded to follow a path using some of the methods
 * available in the {@link Voyager} class.
 * However, Pathfinder can only actually interpret followers - not just
 * trajectories. A {@code FollowerGenerator} provides a way for Pathfinder
 * to interpret trajectories as followers, and thus, interpret trajectories
 * and move the robot accordingly.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Included in the "see" tag of this class JavaDoc is a link to the "generic
 * follower generator." This is the simplest (and probably best) option when
 * it comes to generating followers. Instead of creating your own method of
 * creating new followers, the generic follower generator will produce generic
 * followers - pretty simple, right? Unless you have a very specific use case,
 * generic followers should work more than well enough.
