/**
 * One of the two major components of your robot - firstly, there's odometry,
 * and secondly, there's the drive train!
 *
 * <p>
 * The Drive interface works quite simply. Let's imagine that your robot
 * has a constant state it's in - a translation. This translation has three
 * values:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>forwards/backwards movement (Y)</li>
 *     <li>right/left movement (X)</li>
 *     <li>turning (around the center of the robot) (Z)</li>
 * </ul>
 * At any given point, your robot has one of these translations as its "state."
 * If the robot is stopped, your translation has X, Y, and Z values of
 * 0, 0, and 0 respectively. If your robot is moving 1 forwards, you'd have
 * 1, 0, and 0. If your robot is moving at a 45 degree angle, you'd have
 * 1, 1, and 0 - you're still not turning, but now you're moving along both
 * the X and Y axes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In order for Pathfinder to control your robot, it needs to be able to
 * apply translations to the robot. So every Pathfinder instance requires a
 * Drive instance as well - the drive interface provides a way for Pathfinder
 * to tell your robot which direction to move in and how fast.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It doesn't matter HOW your drive interface is implemented. There are
 * several prebuilt options, such as...
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link xyz.devmello.voyager.drive.MecanumDrive}</li>
 *     <li>{@link xyz.devmello.voyager.drive.SwerveDrive}</li>
 * </ul>
 * ... but it doesn't exactly matter how your drivetrain is implemented, so
 * long as it works. The drivetrain must actually set power to motors - if
 * it doesn't, Pathfinder won't think it's moving, and it thus won't be able
 * to determine where it is.
 * </p>

     * <p>
     * This translation should be relative to the robot, not relative to the
     * field. If you have an absolute translation (NOT relative to the robot),
     * you can use {@link Translation#absoluteToRelative(Translation, Angle)}
     * or {@link Translation#toRelative(Angle)} to convert that translation
     * into a relative translation the robot can then use.

     *                    the robot act accordingly according to the robot's
     *                    position and the robot's current heading. I'm
     *                    currently exhausted and just about entirely unable
     *                    to type, so this isn't coherent, but guess what -
     *                    that really sucks for you, doesn't it?
