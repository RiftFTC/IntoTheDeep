 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #newController(double)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #newInvertedController(double)}</li>

 * If you create a controller using the first method ({@link #newController(double)})
 * and notice that your robot is turning in the opposite direction than the
 * robot should be turning in, use {@link #newInvertedController(double)}.
