/**
 * Exception to be thrown whenever an operation is requested to be performed
 * on a null point.
 *
 * <p>
 * If you keep getting this exception, I'd suggest you check out the very
 * these very lovely methods.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link PointXY#zeroIfNull(PointXY)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link PointXYZ#zeroIfNull(PointXYZ)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * Those methods will ensure that any point you pass is never null. If the
 * point would have been null, the method will return the result of the
 * {@link PointXY#zero()} method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This exception is typically caused by an odometry subsystem reporting a
 * null value. If you keep getting this exception, there's always the chance
 * it's being caused by... an odometry subsystem. Regardless of the cause,
 * these exceptions are widely known as being "not very cool" and "kind of
 * lame," so you should definitely fix them. Good luck!
 * </p>
