/**
 * An interface for encoders. If you'd like to track the angle an encoder
 * is facing, check out {@link AngleEncoder} instead. An encoder should report
 * a quantity (named "ticks") that represents how far the motor has spun since
 * tracking the position of the motor has begun. If a motor were to spin
 * forwards for 10 seconds, and then spin backwards for 10 seconds, at the same
 * speed (in both directions), assuming the motor and encoder are both
 * completely accurate, the encoder should have a position of 0. If it were to
 * spin forwards for 10 seconds, it should have a position double that of if it
 * were to spin forwards for 5 seconds.
 *
 * <p>
 * For most use cases, it's advisable to use {@link AbstractEncoder} instead.
