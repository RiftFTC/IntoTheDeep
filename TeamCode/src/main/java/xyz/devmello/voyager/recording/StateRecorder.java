/**
 * Used in recording the state of a robot. If you've already recorded a
 * state, you can then play that state back. Additionally, you can play
 * back a timed set of states. This functions by using a map containing
 * {@link Recordable}s. Each {@link Recordable}, as its name would suggest,
 * can be recorded. To add, each {@link Recordable} can play back an existing
 * recording.
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@code StateRecorder} exists in one of three states:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Idle</li>
 *     <li>Recording</li>
 *     <li>Playing back</li>
 * </ul>
 * By default, it's in the Idle state. Recording and playback can be
 * started and stoppeed using the following methods:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #startRecording(int, int)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #stopRecording()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #startPlayback(StateRecording)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #stopPlayback()}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, {@code StateRecorder} will automatically "optimize" ongoing
 * recordings by removing redundant information. Specifically, if two adjacent
 * records have the same value for a {@code Recordable}, only the first of
 * those records will be preserved. This helps to cut down on recording output
 * size. This functionality can be configured by changing a flag with
 * {@link #setShouldOptimize(boolean)}.
 * </p>
