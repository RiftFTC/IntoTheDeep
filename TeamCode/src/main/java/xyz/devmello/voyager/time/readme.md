# "me.wobblyyyy.pathfinder2.time" package

The time package of this library is taken from another library I was developing for quite a while for entirely unrelated
purposes. Thus, a lot of it isn't maintained very well - it's been taken from a system designed for smart alarm clocks
and adapted to a system used for autonomous navigation planning.
