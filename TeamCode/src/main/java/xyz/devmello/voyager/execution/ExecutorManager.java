/**
 * A manager, responsible for... well, managing executors. This manager
 * operates on a first-in, first-out basis. Basically, you can add a follower
 * executor to the queue of executors. The manager will continue executing
 * the executor that was added first until it's finished, and then it'll move
 * onto the next executor.
 *
 * <p>
 * There are only two ways you can interact with the queue of executors here.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Add an executor by adding a list of followers.</li>
 *     <li>Clear the entire list of executors.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Executor managers are a relatively simple and limited method of managing
 * autonomous movement - this is completely intentional, as to not
 * overcomplicate usage of the library.
 * </p>
