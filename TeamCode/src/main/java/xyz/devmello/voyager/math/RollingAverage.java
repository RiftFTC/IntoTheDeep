/**
 * A rolling average/moving average is a type of average that takes the
 * average of a predetermined amount of previous numbers. Every time a new
 * number is added to that average, the oldest number in the rolling average
 * (whatever number has an index of size - 1) will be removed from the array,
 * all the other numbers will be shifted over by 1, and the array's 0th
 * number will be the new number.
 *
 * <p>
 * This uses {@link System#arraycopy(Object, int, Object, int, int)} to rotate
 * an array of primitive double values for the sake of speed.
