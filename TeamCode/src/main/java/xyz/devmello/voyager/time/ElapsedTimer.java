/**
 * A very simple timer that keeps track of how much time has been elapsed.
 * This can be used to create time-based loops. As of Pathfinder v0.10.7,
 * the functionality of {@code ElapsedTimer} has been effectively
 * encapsulated in the {@link Time} class: {@link Time#runFor(double, Runnable)}
 *
 * <p>
 * As of Pathfinder v2.1.0, there are some new methods here:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #wait(double)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #waitThenRun(Runnable, double)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #runThenWait(Runnable, double)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #runFor(Runnable, double)}</li>
 * </ul>
