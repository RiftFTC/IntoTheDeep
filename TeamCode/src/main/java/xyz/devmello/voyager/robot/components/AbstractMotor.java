/**
 * An abstract implementation of the {@link Motor} interface. This
 * implementation does a few things - namely, it adds minimum and maximum power
 * values, as well as a feature called "lazy mode."
 *
 * <p>
 * Lazy mode is a feature I saw in another robotics library. Unfortunately,
 * I can't, for the life of me, remember the name of the team that wrote
 * the library or the name of the library - if you happen to know what
 * I'm talking about, do me a favor and insert that name right here. Anyways.
 * Lazy mode is designed to decrease CPU load and free up some busses by not
 * requiring the device running the robot code to set power to the motor every
 * single time the set power method is called. If there's such little
 * difference between the power values that would be set to the motor, there's
 * no point in wasting resources trying to do so.
 * </p>
