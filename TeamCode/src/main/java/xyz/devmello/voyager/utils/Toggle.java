/**
 * A {@code Toggle} is a rather basic concept - it can be in one of two states:
 * on and off. Whenever the toggle is toggled, it'll follow the following
 * pattern:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>If it's off, the toggle will turn to on.</li>
 *     <li>If it's on, the toggle will turn to off.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Toggles are most useful in loop-based code: if you want to have a stateful
 * component that can be toggled with the press of a button, for example,
 * a toggle would be perfect, just like you. {@code :)}
 * </p>
