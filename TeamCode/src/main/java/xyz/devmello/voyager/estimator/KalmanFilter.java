/**
 * Kalman filtering, or linear quadratic estimation, is "an algorithm that
 * uses a series of measurements observed over time, including statistical
 * noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables
 * for each timeframe" (Wikipedia). To be completely honest, I only have
 * a very basic understanding of the math going on here, so the documentation
 * might be... a little bit shaky. Kalman filters are commonly used in
 * autonomous navigation and control software because they help to safeguard
 * against unwanted and extraneous sensor input. In the case of robotics,
 * these filters can be used for several purposes, including measuring the
 * velocity of an encoder, fusing data from multiple sensors, or estimating
 * the robot's position.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that a Kalman filter is designed to reduce noise, NOT increase the
 * accuracy of measurements. The only way to increase the accuracy of those
 * measurements is to increase the accuracy of the tools used in gathering
 * those measurements. If you have values with high accuracy but low precision,
 * one of these bad boys should help you a lot. If you values with low
 * accuracy but high precision... well, I hate to break it to you, but you're
 * really kind of out of luck.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A Kalman filter is based upon three matrices:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>State matrix</li>
 *     <li>Covariance matrix</li>
 *     <li>Projection matrix</li>
 * </ul>
 * Of those three matrices, the state and covariance matrices are the
 * most important - the projection matrix can be disregarded for simple
 * use cases. The state matrix is the filter's current state - if you're
 * using an encoder, for example, this might be the filter's velocity.
 * The covariance matrix determines how heavily each value from the state
 * matrix is weighted - a higher covariance means that the value is less
 * accurate, meaning it will not affect the output as much, while a lower
 * covariance means the value is more accurate, and that value will impact
 * the output more. The projection matrix is used for outputting values.
 * </p>
