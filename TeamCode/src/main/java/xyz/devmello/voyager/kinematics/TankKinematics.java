/**
 * Kinematics for a tank drive (also commonly known as a "differential drive").
 * A tank drive, in the (hopefully unlikely) event you were unaware, is a type
 * of chassis that applies power along two different axes to move the robot.
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, this value is 1 / 180. Because a tank drive can only move along
 * one axis - forwards and backwards - you need a way to convert translations
 * with multiple axes into a translation that can be applied to a differential
 * drive chassis. If a translation has a horizontal component (say (1, 0, 0)),
 * this value will be used in calculating a {@link TankState} that can be
 * applied to the chassis.
