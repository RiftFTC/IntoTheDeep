/**
 * A representation of a swerve module. In a typical swerve drive chassis,
 * there are four swerve modules - the front right, the front left, the
 * back right, and the back left modules. Each of these modules is composed
 * of two motors - the turn motor and the drive motor. In short, the turn
 * motor can control the angle at which the drive motor is facing, and the
 * drive motor can actually drive the robot.
