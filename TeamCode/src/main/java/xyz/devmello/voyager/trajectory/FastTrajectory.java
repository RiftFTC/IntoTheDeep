/**
 * Another rather simple type of trajectory. Like the {@link LinearTrajectory},
 * the {@code FastTrajectory} operates in a linear manner - it'll continue
 * driving towards the target point in a straight line until it reaches the
 * point.
 *
 * <p>
 * Unlike the {@link LinearTrajectory}, however, the {@code FastTrajectory}
 * does two things different:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         It doesn't require the headings to match for the trajectory to
 *         count as being completed.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         The only condition that determines whether a {@code FastTrajectory}
 *         has finished is whether or not the elapsed X and Y distances of the
 *         robot are greater than the difference between the X and Y values
 *         of the start and end points, respectively.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * In other words, whenever you create a new {@code FastTrajectory}, two
 * values will be generated - {@link #minDistanceX} and {@link #minDistanceY}.
 * Whenever the {@link #isDone(PointXYZ)} method is called, two more values
 * will be generated - we'll call them {@code elapsedX} and {@code elapsedY}.
 * If both the elapsed X and elapsed Y values are greater than the minimum
 * X and minimum Y values, the trajectory has been completed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This significantly decreases accuracy, as the robot will not automatically
 * correct its position if it overshoots the target. However, this makes the
 * trajectory require significantly less time in situations where high degrees
 * of accuracy aren't really needed.
 * </p>
