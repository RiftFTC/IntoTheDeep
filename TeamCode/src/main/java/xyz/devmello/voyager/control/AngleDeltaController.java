/**
 * This controller is designed specifically for operations where the robot
 * is being fed angles in degrees or radians. This controller requires a
 * coefficient to be provided. This coefficient will be multiplied by the
 * minimum angle delta.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, let's say the robot is currently facing 90 degrees. We want
 * the robot to face 135 degrees. This controller will calculate that the
 * robot must turn 45 degrees, and then multiply that number (45) by whatever
 * coefficient you provide. This number should typically be very low, but
 * it'll require some testing to get it right.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This controller can operate in one of two modes. Firstly, there's the
 * degrees mode. Secondly, there's the radians mode. By default, unless
 * you specify otherwise, the controller will operate in degrees mode. Anyways.
 * When the {@link #calculate(double)} method is called, it will generate
 * a delta and a coefficient. If the controller is in degrees mode, the delta
 * will be the amount of degrees between the two angles. If the controller
 * is in radians mode, the delta will be the amount of radians between the
 * two angles. Pretty neat, right? Of course it is.
 * </p>
